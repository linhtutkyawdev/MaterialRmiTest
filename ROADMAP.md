# TODOs and Future Plans

# IMPORTANT!

A more complete roadmap is now available at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/RqRwBIRh/materialfx-roadmap)

## Priority Legend

- **HIGH**: you can expect the feature in the next major version
- **LOW**: the feature will be implemented when I feel like it, or if the request is so high that it escalates to **
  HIGH** priority
- **TBD**: the idea is there, the feature will be implemented at some point in the future

Note that you can influence the ROADMAP priority in two ways:

1) There's a high request for the feature
2) You can sponsor the project with the $50 one time tier
