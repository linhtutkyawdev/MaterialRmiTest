/**
 * JavaFX offers a special type of Popup, the {@link PopupControl}, to allow styling
 * its content with CSS. It would be a great control....if only it worked properly, but just like most of JavaFX's
 * controls it is borked too because those code monkeys at JavaFX are dumb.
 * <p></p>
 * Since I could not make it work no matter what I tried I was tired of this bullshit and designed my
 * own solution.
 * <p>
 * {@link MFXPopup} now implements this interface allowing CSS to really fucking work as it should!
 * <p></p>
 * The system is quite simple at the moment:
 * <p>
 * First when creating a {@code MFXStyleablePopup} you must set which is the parent that has the stylesheet,
 * use {@link #setPopupStyleableParent(Parent)}. Then the interface, thanks to a helper class (the {@link MFXCSSBridge},
 * will parse the parent's user agent stylesheet and all its stylesheets automatically, even if changed at runtime (the list
 * will always be rebuilt for simplicity). Then it's up to the popup implementation to connect the bridge to the
 * node on which apply the stylesheets.
