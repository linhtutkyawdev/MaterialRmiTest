/**
 * Base class to define a notification system.
 * <p></p>
 * A notification system has the following info and features:
 * <p> - The {@link Screen} on which to show the notification
 * <p> - The {@link Window} on which the notification system's stage depends (more on that later)
 * <p> - A {@link MFXPopup} which contains the notification
 * <p> - The {@link NotificationPos} to compute the shown notifications' position
 * <p> - Allows to specify some extra spacing between the screen's borders and the notification
 * <p> - By default is animated but it can also be disabled
 * <p> - By default notifications will close automatically after 3 seconds (by default)
 * <p></p>
 * To fix issue #80 and similar, the notification system do not uses the focused window anymore but
 * it has its own "dummy" stage. It is a UTILITY stage, so that no icon appear in the taskbar, and its opacity is 0.
 * While this is a great improvement over the old design there's also a downside.
 * When the JavaFX's primary stage is closed the app won't close because the "dummy" stage is still open,
 * to fix this a notification system must be initialized with an owner window, so that when owner is closed
 * the "dummy" stage is closed too.
 * <p></p>
 * Any notification system ideally must implement the following behaviors:
 * <p> - publish: the method that accepts and manages new notifications
 * <p> - show: ideally called by the publish method, serves to specify how to show the new notification
 * <p> - close: serves to specify how a notification should be closed
 * <p> - scheduleReopen: this method specifies how the notification system behaves when
 * a new notification is published but it already is in a showing/closing state. Ideally this method
 * should instruct the notification system to ignore the new notification and recall publish as soon as the current
 * notification is being closed.
 * <p> - computePosition: computes the position of the notification as a {@link TransitionPositionBean} for use
 * with animations too. (for non animated systems just subtract the deltas from their respective coordinates)
 * <p></p>
 * Side note on the close method: it's highly recommended to also close the popup since it is not transparent
 * and mouse won't work through. (may block OS windows)
 * <p></p>
 * Side notes on the scheduleReopen mechanism: this base class offers two {@link ResettableBooleanProperty} to
 * specify that the notification is showing/closing a notification. Show and hide methods should set these properties
 * to true as the first operation, and then reset them once the notification is closed (see implementations source code for examples).
 * The scheduleReopen should instruct the system to call publish as soon as the closing property becomes false.
 * <p></p>
 * Last note: notification systems ideally should be singletons.
