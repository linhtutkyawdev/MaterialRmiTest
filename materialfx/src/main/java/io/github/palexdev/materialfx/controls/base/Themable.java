/**
 * Public API for all controls that are integrated with the new Theming API, see {@link Theme}.
 * <p></p>
 * Ideally such controls should be instances of {@link Parent} for "proper" support in SceneBuilder, and they should specify
 * which is their own "theme"/stylesheet.
 * <p></p>
 * <b>SceneBuilder Support</b>
 * <p>
 * By default, all controls implementing this will automatically check upon creation if they are being used inside SceneBuilder.
 * When the software is detected, the control' stylesheet is added to itself, this is done on every new control added to the scene.
 * <p>
 * Despite appearances, this is the simplest and <b>fastest</b> solution.
 * <p>
 * Other approaches would involve adding a listener on the scene property of the node to detect when it was available.
 * Then the {@link Theme} were added to the scene. This is not feasible as controls have two scenes in two separate moments:
 * <p> 1) When the control is dragged into the main scene, the "drag effect" you see is basically a moving popup, so it's not the main scene
 * <p> 2) When the mouse is released and the control is placed, it is then in the main scene
 * <p>
 * Styling only the main scene resulted in an "ugly" experience since controls in the drag popup would be un-styled.
 * Styling both would lead to a huge performance drawback of the app, because now JavaFX would have to process the themes
 * (the entire themes!) on TWO scenes.
 * <p></p>
 * This approach on the other hand not only is fast, but it should also be more flexible. From my tests, it seems that
 * adding stylesheets to each component doesn't break styling, you will still be able to add stylesheets to each control
 * individually or on its parent, and it should still work fine in any case.
 * <p></p>
 * As always, bugs and unexpected behaviors are behind the corner, that's why there's also an emergency switch to completely
 * shut off the SceneBuilder integration.
 * <p>
 * To do so, it's just enough to create a file in the following directories:
 * <p> - For Windows users: ~\AppData\Local\Scene Builder
 * <p> - For MacOS users: ~/Library/Application Support/Scene Builder
 * <p> - For Linux users: ~/.scenebuilder
 * In the folder relative to your OS, create a file named exactly like this: MFX_SB_OFF
