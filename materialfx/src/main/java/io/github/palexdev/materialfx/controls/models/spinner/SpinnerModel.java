/**
 * Defines the public API for all models to be used with {@link MFXSpinner}.
 * <p>
 * {@code SpinnerModel} is basically a helper class to allow the spinner to work on any object
 * type as long as a model exists for it. The model is responsible for changing the spinner's value by
 * going forward or backwards ({@link #next()} or {@link #previous()}).
 * <p>
 * Along this core functionality the model also specifies a {@link StringConverter} which will be
 * used to convert the T value to a String, which will be the spinner's text.
 * <p>
 * The spinner should also allow to cycle through the values, meaning that when reaching the the last value,
 * {@link #next()} will go to the first value (and the other way around)
